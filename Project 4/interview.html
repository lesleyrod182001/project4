        I asked the question "why don't you like pineapples on pizza?" and these are the responses that I got:

        Because there two different flavors sometimes it’s good to mix flavors but then you're also mixing the citrus sort of flavor but with a pasty sort texture and those don't go together <br> 
        and then you're just mixing sauces and it's a no also it's like dairy and you don't drink milk when you're eating strawberries and especially lemons, like pineapple, why would you have cheese with it like you don't put cheese on your pineapple - Trina </left> </font>

         It's not the right combo its doesnt compliment each other you have cheese and bread and tomato sauce which is all very normal good things separately when you have pineapple which is a fruit and it's very acidic and it's very sour it doesn't taste right on something that's supposed to be so good and pineapple in general isn't that good but when you put it on pizza it's like a crime and its not right and its unruly it's terrible - Lane   </right> </font>

         It tastes very odd fruits don't belong on Pizza you know it has good ingredients  like any toppings  like pepperoni or cheese and pineapple just ruins that it’s pretty garbage - David

        Because  pineapples should be served room temperature or cold because they're refreshing especially Citrus or tropical fruit like pineapple I don't think they should be served warm and as a result I don't think it should be  served on pizza. - Donald

        I don't like the texture of pineapple and also it's tropical with something really greasy and I don't think that compliments each other.  -Erica

        <font color="#999966">
        Because that is just inhumane why would a fruit go on tomato sauce I just don't get it who does that I don't get why it’s a thing. - Amber

         Pizza is good on its own and pineapple just  ruins it the flavor doesn't mix You have like a sweet fruit that's really chewy  and it doesn't go well with warm with warm tasty dairy of pizza  pineapples are too sweet and mushy to eat.  - Ethan
