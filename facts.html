        1) The fact is many people think that the beloved “Hawaiian Pizza” was originated from Hawaii, real truth is that someone from Canada created it 
        <br> 
        <br> 
        2) People who like pineapple pizza probably have bad taste buds and would be down to eat anything to try to prove pineapple pizza is good 
        <br> 
        <br>
        3) People who like pineapple pizza try to justify their reasoning by trying to bring down vegetables and saying it’s weird (you eat pineapple pizza) 
        <br> 
        <br> 
        4) People also try to justify by saying “tomato is a fruit”
        <br> 
        <br> 
        5) Whoever is able to enjoy a sour fruit on top of dairy is the devil get away from them
